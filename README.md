# Crypto Portfolio Dashboard Project Description

A real-time crypto portfolio dashboard has been developed, tracking investments across 17 different coins. The dashboard is designed in INR (₹) and provides a comprehensive, data-driven view of the portfolio’s performance, leveraging live API data and advanced DAX calculations. The solution is spread across two interactive pages, each offering unique insights and controls for effective portfolio management.

# Problem Statement

Before this dashboard, crypto investors faced several challenges:

    • Manual Tracking: Investors had to manually update and track coin prices, quantities, and portfolio values, leading to errors and inefficiency.
    • Lack of Real-Time Data: Most solutions did not provide live updates, making it hard to react to market changes.
    • No INR Support: Many platforms showed values in USD or other currencies, making it difficult for Indian investors to assess real returns.
    • Limited Historical Analysis: Tracking historical performance and trends over a year was cumbersome.
    • Complex Calculations: Calculating ROI, net profit/loss, and other metrics required manual effort or complex spreadsheets.
    • Scalability Issues: Managing and analyzing a large number of coins (up to 600) was not feasible with basic tools.

# Solution Features & How Problems Were Solved

    1. Real-Time Data Integration
          • Live API links fetch the latest prices and historical data for all coins, ensuring the dashboard always reflects current market conditions.
          • Daily refresh provides up-to-date information for the last 365 days.

    2. Comprehensive Coin Coverage
          • The dashboard supports up to 600 coins with logos, allowing users to analyze a wide range of assets.
          • Slicers enable quick filtering and selection of specific coins for detailed analysis.

    3. INR-Based Calculations
          • All values, including investment, current value, profit/loss, and ROI, are displayed in INR, making it highly relevant for Indian users.

    4. Advanced Analytics with DAX
          • DAX functions are used for complex calculations such as:
          ◦ Coin-wise and total ROI
          ◦ Net profit/loss
          ◦ Historical price trends
          ◦ Dynamic card values using SELECTEDVALUE for context-sensitive metrics

    5. User-Friendly Visualization
          • Interactive charts show price trends, coin quantities, and portfolio distribution.
          • Cards display key metrics like coin price, rank, current value, holding, net profit, ROI, ATH (All-Time High), ATL (All-Time Low), and buy price.
          • Pie and bar charts provide visual summaries of holdings and performance.

    6. Historical Performance Tracking
        • The dashboard includes a full year (365 days) of historical price and performance data, enabling users to analyze trends and make informed decisions.

    7. Portfolio Summary
  
# The  page aggregates total investment, current value, ROI, and net profit/loss for the entire portfolio, giving a clear overview at a glance.
